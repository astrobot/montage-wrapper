{"name":"montage-wrapper","tagline":"A Python wrapper for the IPAC Montage mosaicking software","body":"The **montage-wrapper** module (formerly python-montage) is an <a href=\"http://www.astropy.org\">Astropy affiliated</a> package that provides a way to run the <a href=\"http://montage.ipac.caltech.edu/\">Montage Astronomical Image Mosaic Engine</a> from Python, including both functions to access individual Montage commands, and high-level functions to facilitate mosaicking and reprojecting. Once the IPAC Montage software is installed, installing the Python wrapper is straightforward:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip install montage-wrapper\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce installed, using the Montage wrapper is simple - any Montage command has a Python function equivalent:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import montage_wrapper as montage\r\n>>> montage.mArchiveList('2MASS', 'K', 'm31', 0.5, 0.5, 'm31.tbl')\r\ncount : 18\r\nstat : OK\r\n```\r\n\r\nand there are also convenience functions provided, for example a function to run the mosaicking process from start to end:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> montage.mosaic('raw_tiles', 'final_mosaic')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"http://montage-wrapper.readthedocs.org\">documentation</a> contains more details on installing and using the module.\r\n\r\nTo report bugs and request features, please use the <a href=\"https://github.com/astropy/montage-wrapper/issues\">issue tracker</a>.
